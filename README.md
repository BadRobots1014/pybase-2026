# PyBase 2026

Our goal for **PyBase** is to maintain a solid, working swerve drivetrain so that we have a strong foundation to build on every single year.

2026 is the year we officially made the switch from Java to Python. This is an orphaned version of [EWall25/swervepy](https://github.com/EWall25/swervepy) that is tailored specifically for our team's needs.

**Everyone is welcome** to use or contribute to this code. Just a heads-up: this is primarily built for Team 1014’s specific robots, so expect some breaking changes as we tweak and add things.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep this repo clean. Any changes to swerve or its core components happen here. At the start of a new season, we fork this repo so that season-specific code doesn't clutter up the main template.

## Team Wiki

The [**Wiki**](https://github.com/BadRobots1014/pybase-2026/wiki) is our central hub for everything FRC, programming, and codebase-related.

Whether you’re a rookie or a seasoned member, we definitely encourage you to read through it. If you learn something new or find a better way to do things, please contribute.
It’s the best way to make sure the "team of tomorrow" doesn't have to start from zero.
